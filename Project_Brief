This is laravel based application that does not use front-end , and work as an API.
This Application allows users who are authenticated to apply for a loan and if approved make payment against it.

For the Protected routes Laravel Sanctum Is used because this package  provides a featherweight authentication system for SPAs and token based API's.

Beside the Login Page All Routes are protected by middleware which checks the authentication token.
For login throttle is set for 60 request per minute ,so to limit request and control load on system and also decline repeated login attempts.

When user tries to login thorugh email and password and if credentials as correct a token is provided to user, this token is stored within the server not client side and can be used
managed itself from server , which was one of the reason to use this package along with its lightness.


For the authentication code you can Refer to AuthenticationController in app/http/controllers/  folder.
for the Loan related Code you can Refer to LoanController in app/http/controllers/ folder.


Test cases are also made under folder - tests/Feature.
